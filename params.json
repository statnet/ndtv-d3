It takes JSON-formatted input files (normally produced by ndtv) describing the node positions, changing network relationships and graphic properties and displays them as a 'movie' illustrating the changes in a network object over time. The 'movie' is a zoomable, interactive SVG object with animation play controls and a scrub-able timeline for navigation.  \r\n\r\nThe ndtv-d3 library was created by  and Skye Bender-deMoll for the [statnet project](http://statnet.org) funded by NICHD grant R01HD068395. Based on 'statnet' project software (http://statnetproject.org).
